At the main+25 we can see the binary compare our argument with 0x1a7 (423 in decimal) with the command below:

gdb -batch -ex "set disassembly-flavor intel" -ex "b *main+25" -ex "run" -ex "continue" --args ./level0 "423"

I we pass the 423 argument, we have a shell with the level1 user right for get the level1 flag like below:

$ cat ../level1/.pass
